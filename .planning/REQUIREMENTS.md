# Requirements: hyperscale UI/UX Improvements

**Defined:** 2026-02-07
**Core Value:** Players experience smooth, responsive gameplay with consistent visual design across all 8 game stages

## v1 Requirements

### Layout System (LAYOUT)

- [x] **LAYOUT-01**: Unified responsive layout system implemented
  - Desktop (≥1024px): Centered layout with `items-center justify-center`
  - Mobile (<1024px): Top-anchored layout with `items-start pt-20`
  
- [x] **LAYOUT-02**: Visual jumps eliminated between all 8 screens
  - Intro, Personality Select, Role Select, Initializing use consistent layout
  - Game screen refactored to use same LayoutShell component
  - Boss Fight, Game Over, Summary screens aligned
  
- [x] **LAYOUT-03**: Desktop scrollbar layout shifts prevented
  - Implement `scrollbar-gutter: stable` on desktop (>1024px)
  - Centered content stays centered when scrollbar appears/disappears
  
- [x] **LAYOUT-04**: Mobile viewport instability fixed
  - Replace all `min-h-screen` (100vh) with `min-h-[100dvh]`
  - Content no longer shifts when mobile browser toolbars collapse/expand
  
- [x] **LAYOUT-05**: Reusable LayoutShell component created
  - Component accepts `children`, optional `header`, optional `footer`
  - Handles responsive breakpoints internally
  - Used by all 8 game stages consistently

### Swipe Interactions (SWIPE)

- [ ] **SWIPE-01**: Spring physics snap-back animation implemented
  - CSS `cubic-bezier(0.34, 1.56, 0.64, 1)` for soft bouncy return
  - Triggered when swipe released under threshold (100px)
  - Duration: 500-600ms for natural feel
  
- [ ] **SWIPE-02**: Card lift effect on drag start
  - Scale from 1.0 to 1.05 when `isDragging` becomes true
  - Box shadow increases for depth perception
  - Smooth transition (200ms) on drag start
  
- [ ] **SWIPE-03**: Card stack showing next card underneath
  - Next card rendered behind current card with `z-index: 0`
  - Scale: 0.95, Opacity: 0.6 for depth effect
  - Same size and dimensions as current card
  
- [ ] **SWIPE-04**: Enhanced gradient/text swipe preview
  - Red gradient overlay when swiping left (scales with distance)
  - Green gradient overlay when swiping right (scales with distance)
  - Text label ("DEBUG", "PASTE", etc.) scales from 0.5 to 1.0 with distance
  - Appears when swipe exceeds 50px (SWIPE_PREVIEW_THRESHOLD)
  
- [ ] **SWIPE-05**: Smooth card exit animations
  - Left exit: `translateX(-120%) rotate(-25deg)` + fade out
  - Right exit: `translateX(120%) rotate(25deg)` + fade out
  - Duration: 350ms with `cubic-bezier(0.25, 0.46, 0.45, 0.94)`

### Transitions (TRANS)

- [ ] **TRANS-01**: Consistent stage transition animations
  - All 8 stages use same `stage-transition` animation class
  - Animation: fade + scale (0.98 → 1.0) + translateY (20px → 0)
  - Duration: 400-500ms
  - No directional transitions (fade only) to avoid confusion with swipe

### Design Audit (DESIGN)

- [ ] **DESIGN-01**: Visual design audited and aligned across screens
  - Typography consistent (font sizes, weights, line heights)
  - Color palette consistent (slate grays, cyan accents)
  - Spacing consistent (padding, margins, gaps)
  - Component styles consistent (buttons, cards, inputs)
  - Border radius and shadows consistent

### Performance (PERF)

- [ ] **PERF-01**: Touch gesture performance optimized
  - `will-change: transform` on swipeable card
  - `backface-visibility: hidden` for GPU acceleration
  - `-webkit-font-smoothing: antialiased` for crisp text
  - Passive event listeners where possible

## v2 Requirements (Future Milestones)

### Sound & Haptics
- **SOUND-01**: Audio feedback for swipe actions
- **SOUND-02**: Background music or ambient sound
- **HAPTIC-01**: Vibration feedback on mobile (10ms on threshold cross)

### Advanced Animations
- **ANIM-01**: Stats update animations (budget/heat/hype changes)
- **ANIM-02**: HUD progress bar smooth transitions
- **ANIM-03**: Roaster Terminal text reveal animation

### Accessibility
- **A11Y-01**: Full keyboard navigation (already partially implemented)
- **A11Y-02**: Screen reader optimizations
- **A11Y-03**: Reduced motion support (`prefers-reduced-motion`)

## Out of Scope

| Feature | Reason |
|---------|--------|
| Native mobile apps (iOS/Android) | Browser-first approach sufficient; native wrappers add complexity |
| Icon-based swipe feedback (✕/✓) | Contextual text labels ("Debug"/"Paste") more meaningful for varied decisions |
| Card opacity fade during swipe | Could make card text unreadable during decision-making |
| Server-side features | Keep client-side only; no backend dependencies wanted |
| Multiplayer/social features | Single player focus for this milestone |
| View Transition API | Overkill for this project; CSS animations sufficient |

## Traceability
