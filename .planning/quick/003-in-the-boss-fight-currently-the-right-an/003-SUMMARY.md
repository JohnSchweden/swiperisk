# Quick Task 003: Boss Fight Answer Randomization

**Randomized answer positions in boss fight using sort(() => Math.random() - 0.5)**

## Performance

- **Duration:** <5 min
- **Tasks:** 1/1
- **Files modified:** 1

## Accomplishments
- Added answer shuffling to useBossFight hook
- Correct answer now appears in random position (A, B, C, or D)
- All 4 answer positions equally likely

## Task Commits

1. **Task 1: Randomize answer position in useBossFight** - `9964a3b` (feat)
   - Modified line 62 in hooks/useBossFight.ts
   - Changed from `[question.correctAnswer, ...question.wrongAnswers]`
   - To `[question.correctAnswer, ...question.wrongAnswers].sort(() => Math.random() - 0.5)`

## Files Modified
- `hooks/useBossFight.ts` - Added answer randomization using sort

## Decisions Made
- Used `Math.random() - 0.5` for Fisher-Yates-like shuffle
- Simple inline solution vs. imported shuffle utility

## Verification
- Boss fight tests pass: `bunx playwright test tests/stage-snapshots.spec.ts` shows boss-fight tests passing on both desktop and mobile

## Deviations from Plan

None - plan executed exactly as written.

## Next Phase Readiness

- Answer randomization complete
- Boss fight quiz now challenging (not predictable)
