# Lessons

Patterns to prevent repeat mistakes. Update after corrections from the user.

## Tool Usage

- [RULE] Always prefix ALL commands with `rtk` — no exceptions, even for simple/short commands. Full list from `rtk discover`: `rtk git log`, `rtk git diff`, `rtk bun run`, `rtk grep`, `rtk head`, `rtk ls`, `rtk find`, `rtk gh`, `rtk curl`, `rtk brew`, `rtk diff`, `rtk tsc`
- [RULE] Never use `bunx` — use `rtk bun` instead (e.g., `rtk bun playwright test`) — bunx bypasses RTK token savings
- [RULE] Never use bare `git` subcommands — always `rtk git log`, `rtk git diff`, `rtk git status`, etc.
- [RULE] Chain all piped commands with rtk prefixes in one Bash call: `rtk bun ... | rtk grep ... | rtk head ...`

**Capture process:**
1. Add learnings here after sessions
2. Use format: `- [RULE] — Why this matters`
3. At end of session, promote broad patterns to `~/.claude/lessons.md` (global) or `memory/*.md`
4. Update `MEMORY.md` index

## Code & Architecture

<!-- Project-specific patterns only. Generic patterns live in ~/.claude/lessons.md -->

<!-- Captured 2026-03-26 via post-commit analysis -->
- [RULE] In card decks with narrative violations, verify each card's deathVector semantically matches its violation/lesson. Reuse of the same death ending across multiple semantically different violations indicates incomplete content needing review — Narrative coherence breaks when outcomes don't match the failure mode (e.g., optimization loophole → CONGRESS/governance vs singularity risk → PRISON/legal consequences). Repeated generic values suggest placeholder data left in.

<!-- Captured 2026-03-26 via post-commit analysis -->
- [RULE] When state lookups reference a computed override value, use the same fallback sequence everywhere to prevent divergence — Different patterns (one using direct lookup, one using computed ?? default) reference different data when the override differs, causing state sync bugs between components. Enforce consistency across all paths and document the synchronization requirement ("same instance as X") in comments.

<!-- Captured 2026-03-26 via post-commit analysis -->
- [RULE] Pre-baked side-specific assets must key off the same object the player saw. If `shuffleDeck` already swaps `onLeft`/`onRight`, do not invert again from `choiceSidesSwapped` — Double inversion plays the opposite branch’s audio while the overlay shows the correct line (e.g. KPI roaster text with “document honestly” clip).

<!-- Captured 2026-03-26 via post-commit analysis -->
- [RULE] When exposing state objects with side-specific fields through tool APIs, include semantic metadata (like feedbackAuthoringStem) alongside presence flags — Tools need both "does feedback exist?" and "which side was it authored for?" to make correct decisions. Exposing only boolean presence is incomplete and forces consumers to guess intent.

<!-- Captured 2026-03-28 via post-commit analysis -->
- [RULE] When exposing game state through tool APIs (WebMCP, etc.), audit all tool consumer code to ensure every referenced field is included in the state payload — Missing fields cause silent failures where tools cannot access state they need, and no error is raised.

<!-- Captured 2026-03-28 via post-commit analysis -->
- [RULE] Audio playback effects coordinating on the same behavior (death audio, victory audio) must reference the same canonical GameStage value across all effects. Outcome screens use `DEBRIEF_PAGE_1` (death when `deathType` is set, victory when null); keep triggers aligned with that stage and `deathType`, not split legacy stages.

<!-- Captured 2026-03-30 via post-commit analysis -->
- [RULE] When card types require special asset handling (like Kirk-breach cards), provide type-specific fallback UI (e.g., glitch placeholder) instead of generic null returns — preserves narrative identity and prevents UI gaps when specialized assets are missing or delayed. Check the card's identifying pattern (slug prefix) and render accordingly, not just `return null` for all missing images.

<!-- Captured 2026-03-30 via post-commit analysis -->
- [RULE] When rendering type-specific content (explanation, lesson blocks for different death endings), always gate each piece with its type discriminator (isKirk, regularDeathType), not just the content presence check — Multiple death types may have the same fields populated, and absence of the type guard causes content to render for the wrong ending type.

## Testing & Verification

<!-- Project-specific testing patterns only. Generic Playwright/Vitest patterns live in ~/.claude/lessons.md -->

<!-- Captured 2026-04-05 via post-commit analysis -->
- [RULE] When removing a card ID, audit ALL data generation and helper scripts that reference it (generate-*.ts, *-CARDS arrays) — Dead references in generation scripts create orphaned audio files and build bloat; card deletions require updates across multiple files, not just card data and tests.

<!-- Captured 2026-04-05 via post-commit analysis -->
- [RULE] When test helpers represent objects modified by upstream functions (like `shuffleDeck` swapping card sides), simulate the actual mutation in test setup, not just set a flag — Tests that only set `choiceSidesSwapped: true` without actually swapping `onLeft`/`onRight` hide bugs where the downstream code re-applies the transformation. Test state must match the actual state the code receives in production.

<!-- Captured 2026-04-07 -->
- [RULE] iOS Safari makes `HTMLAudioElement.volume` read-only (always returns 1). Never use `el.volume = x` for volume control — it silently no-ops on iOS. Instead, route audio through `AudioContext.createMediaElementSource()` → `GainNode` → `ctx.destination` and control volume via `gainNode.gain.value`. This is a permanent platform constraint, not a bug.
- [RULE] When a bug appears on mobile, check platform API limitations before theorizing about race conditions or state bugs. Mobile Safari has many read-only properties and gesture requirements that differ from desktop Chrome.

<!-- Captured 2026-04-07 via post-commit analysis -->
- [RULE] Use viewport media queries (aligned with CSS framework breakpoints) to adjust audio parameters for different form factors — Mobile speakers are smaller and need stronger ducking (lower multiplier) to cut through ambient noise; desktop doesn't. Use `window.matchMedia("(max-width: 767px)")` keyed off the same breakpoint as CSS (e.g., Tailwind `md` at 768px), and document why each viewport needs its setting.

<!-- Captured 2026-04-11 via post-commit analysis -->
- [RULE] Preload outcome/result images for both choices before the user makes a selection (not after swipe) — prevents visual lag/flash of unstyled content when the outcome is revealed. Coordinate preload cleanup via useEffect (dependency on currentCard) with return cleanup functions to prevent resource leaks during card transitions.

<!-- Captured 2026-04-11 via post-commit analysis -->
- [RULE] Add `loading="eager"` to outcome/result display images in FeedbackOverlay and debrief pages — These images appear in response to user swipes or game completion and must render immediately; default lazy-loading defers fetch until viewport entry, causing visible lag during critical moments.
