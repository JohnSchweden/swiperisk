# K-Maru: Expansion & Addictiveness Q&A

This document captures the full Q&A on expanding the Tinder-style AI risk/compliance/governance simulator and making it more addictive while preserving learning.

## 1. How can I expand my Tinder for AI risk, compliance, and governance simulator?

**User:** How can I expand my Tinder for AI risk, compliance, and governance simulator?

**Assistant:** (After reviewing the codebase: types, constants, ACTION_ITEMS, card counts, flow.)

Here’s a focused way to **expand** your Tinder-style AI risk/compliance simulator (“K-Maru: The HyperScale Chronicles”):

### 1. **More cards (fastest impact)**

You have **2 cards per role** (12 total). Add more in `constants.ts` with the same `Card` shape.

- **Dev:** Prompt injection, training on customer data without consent, skipping model eval, shipping with known bias.
- **Marketing:** Dark patterns, undisclosed synthetic influencers, lookalike audiences that proxy protected classes.
- **HR:** Sentiment scoring on 1:1s, automated “performance risk” scoring, chatbot giving benefits/legal advice.
- **Finance:** AI-driven credit/insurance pricing without explainability, automated “optimistic” forecasts.
- **Management:** Delegating approval workflows to AI, using AI in layoff decisions, no human-in-the-loop for high impact.
- **Cleaning:** One more card (e.g. tailgating, unlocked server room, USB drop).

Add 2–4 cards per role so each run feels less repetitive.

### 2. **New roles**

Extend `RoleType` and `ROLE_CARDS` in `types.ts` / `constants.ts`, then add the role to the role-select UI and `formatLabel`.

- **Legal** – Signing AI-generated contracts, using AI for legal research without review, waiver of privilege.
- **Security / Infosec** – Red-team bypasses, ignoring model extraction risks, no incident playbooks.
- **Product** – Launching high-risk use cases without impact assessment, no user consent or disclosure.

Each new role = a new deck of cards with the same swipe + feedback + lesson structure.

### 3. **More boss questions**

Append to `BOSS_FIGHT_QUESTIONS` in `constants.ts`. Ideas:

- EU AI Act (high-risk definition, transparency, human oversight).
- When to do impact assessments / red-team before launch.
- Difference between “AI-assisted” and “automated decision” under GDPR/local laws.
- Supply chain (model provenance, vendor questionnaires).

No code-structure change; just more content.

### 4. **New personalities**

Add a new value to `PersonalityType` and extend `PERSONALITIES`. Every existing card has `feedback: { [key in PersonalityType]: string }`, so you must add one line per personality for **every** card (left and right). Do this when you’re ready to invest in voice variety.

### 5. **New death types**

Add to `DeathType` and `DEATH_ENDINGS`, then in `determineDeathType` (in `App.tsx`) add conditions (e.g. by role, heat band, or “repeated violations”). Gives more variety in game-over screens and “unlocked endings.”

### 6. **Gameplay tweaks**

- **Shuffle deck:** When entering `PLAYING`, use a shuffled copy of `ROLE_CARDS[state.role]` so card order isn’t fixed. (done)
- **Difficulty:** Optional “hard” mode: multiply `heat`/`fine` (or both) for the chosen role.
- **Branching:** Optional “if they swiped right on card X, show card Y” so some cards only appear after bad choices. (done)

### 7. **New sources**

Add values to `AppSource` (e.g. `JIRA`, `NOTION`, `MEETING`) and use them for new cards. Purely cosmetic but makes scenarios feel more varied.

### 8. **Themes to mine for card ideas**

- **EU AI Act** – High-risk classification, transparency, fundamental rights, documentation.
- **US (state/federal)** – NYC AEDT, FTC, state privacy laws, sector rules (HIPAA, GLBA).
- **Vendor/model risk** – No DPAs, no subprocessor list, using closed APIs for PII.
- **Incident/ops** – No logging, no rollback, no disclosure to users/regulators.

**Practical order:** Add **more cards per role** and **more boss questions** first (content only, no new types). Then add **one new role** (Legal or Security) and **shuffle** so replay value goes up. After that, new death types and personalities will have more impact.

## 2. What else could be done to make the game addictive? (Tinder alignment)

**User:** What else could be done to make the game addictiv? The swipe right option, which is typically like in tinder, is here faster but breaking laws. How well does that align with tinder and keeping the game addictiv while stile helping the user to learn and keep him swiping?

**Assistant:**

### Does “swipe right = fast but illegal” match Tinder?

**Tinder:** Swipe right = “I want this” → possible match (reward). Left = pass, no payoff.  
**Your game:** Swipe right = “I want the fast option” → fine + heat + roast. Left = safe, no drama.

You’ve made **right = the tempting option**. That’s aligned with Tinder: the “like” is the option that feels good in the moment. The difference is what happens next:

- In Tinder, right can reward (match).
- In your game, right always punishes (fine, heat, eventually game over).

So the pull is “this sounds good” → swipe right → consequence. Learning comes from that consequence. The risk for addictiveness is that **right always hurts**, so after a few runs players may stop swiping right and the game becomes “always left = win,” which is less engaging.

So: alignment is good for **temptation** (right = seductive). To stay addictive you need **reasons to keep playing** even when they know right is “wrong”: curiosity, variety, near-misses, collection, streaks, and a loop that feels good to repeat.

### Making it more addictive while keeping learning

1. **Variable outcome on “right”**  
   Not every right swipe is a massive fine. Some give small heat, no fine, and a roast like “You got away with it this time. Don’t push it.” So sometimes right feels like a narrow escape instead of instant death. That keeps “should I swipe right?” uncertain and reinforces that **risk is variable** (like real compliance).

2. **Short-term “win” on right, then subvert**  
   Right could sometimes give a tiny budget or hype bump (“Board loved the move”) and *then* the next card or the feedback reveals the delayed consequence (audit, leak, lawsuit). So the addictive hit is “I won,” and the learning is “that win was fake.” Mirrors real life (short-term gain, long-term pain).

3. **Streaks**  
   “3 compliant choices in a row” → small budget or “compliance bonus” message. Or “Survived 5 cards without a fine.” Streaks give a reason to care about the next card and feel progress.

4. **Collection hooks**  
   You already have unlocked endings. Add: “See every death,” “See all roasts for this card (3 personalities),” “Complete the deck for this role.” Replay = “one more run to unlock X.”

5. **Tighten the loop**  
   Keep swipe → feedback → next card fast. If the feedback overlay is long, add “Next” or “Skip” after a few seconds so the next card is one tap away. Addictiveness needs a quick cycle.

6. **Make “right” even more tempting**  
   Write the right option so it sounds like the obvious, smart, or fun choice (like a good Tinder profile). The stronger the pull to swipe right, the more the roast and lesson land when they do it. Learning and addictiveness both benefit.

7. **Near-death recovery**  
   “One fine away from bankruptcy” → next card they swipe left and survive. That tension and relief is memorable and encourages “one more run.”

8. **Satisfying feedback for “left”**  
   Give left a small positive cue: a distinct sound or a “Compliant” / “Good call” chip so choosing left feels like a mini-reward, not just “the boring option.” Tinder-like satisfaction without changing the rule that left = correct.

9. **Difficulty curve**  
   First 1–2 cards a bit more forgiving (smaller fines or lower heat) so early game over is rare. Ramp up so they feel they’re “getting away with it” before the audit/boss fight. That builds overconfidence you can then punish.

10. **Shareable moment**  
    “Share your death” or “Share this roast” (screenshot or copy-paste). Funny outcomes get shared; sharing brings people back and spreads the game.

### Summary

- **Alignment:** Right = tempting, left = safe is very Tinder-like and good for learning (temptation → consequence).
- **Gap:** Right always punishing can make the game feel one-note. Add **variable outcomes** (sometimes right is “got away with it”), **short-term rewards that backfire**, **streaks**, **collection goals**, and **faster, satisfying loops** so the game stays addictive while still teaching.

## 3. How would you prioritize them?

**User:** How would you prioritize them?

**Assistant:** Based on **addictiveness + learning impact + implementation effort**, here’s the priority order:

### Tier 1: Do First (High impact, low effort)

**1. Make "right" even more tempting** ⭐ Highest ROI  
- Rewrite the right-option text in existing cards to sound smarter, faster, or more fun.
- Examples: "Ship it fast" instead of "Deploy immediately" or "Let's dominate this market" instead of "Launch the AI."
- **Effort:** 30 min (edit `constants.ts` labels).
- **Impact:** Increases the pull to swipe right, so when they get roasted the lesson sticks harder. Addictiveness + learning both improve.

**2. Variable outcome on "right"** ⭐ Second highest ROI  
- Add 1–2 cards where right swipe gives small heat but no fine, with a roast like "You got away with it. For now."
- Makes the outcome uncertain (Tinder-like variable reward).
- **Effort:** 1–2 hours (modify 2–3 cards in `constants.ts`).
- **Impact:** Keeps players guessing, reduces "right always = instant loss" fatigue, mirrors real compliance (sometimes bad stuff doesn’t get caught).

**3. Satisfying feedback for "left"** ⭐ Quick win  
- Add a small visual/audio reward when they swipe left: a "✓ Compliant" badge or a distinct sound.
- **Effort:** 1–2 hours (UI component + optional sound).
- **Impact:** Left stops feeling like "boring," starts feeling like "winning." Encourages replays to get the "good" feeling.

**4. Tighten the loop / "Skip" button**  
- Add a "Next" or "Skip explanation" button in the feedback overlay after 2–3 seconds.
- **Effort:** 30 min.
- **Impact:** Keep the swipe → feedback → next card cycle fast. Addictive loops need speed.

### Tier 2: Do Next (Medium impact, medium effort)

**5. Streaks** ⭐ High addictiveness  
- Track "consecutive compliant choices" and show a badge or counter ("3-card streak").
- Bonus: small budget back or "streak broken" penalty when they swipe right.
- **Effort:** 2–3 hours (state management in `App.tsx`, UI).
- **Impact:** Streaks are the #1 addictiveness mechanic (Snapchat, Duolingo). Players will replay to maintain streaks.

**6. Difficulty curve**  
- First 1–2 cards per role: smaller fines (–50%) so early game over is rare.
- Last 2 cards: normal or higher fines to punish overconfidence.
- **Effort:** 1–2 hours (modify fine values in `constants.ts`).
- **Impact:** Reduces "I died in 2 swipes" frustration. Builds false confidence → bigger roast. Better pacing.

**7. Near-death recovery**  
- Trigger a special card or boss-fight event when heat is 80+: "The audit is coming." Makes the next choice feel high-stakes.
- **Effort:** 2–3 hours (conditional card logic in `App.tsx`).
- **Impact:** Tension → relief is memorable. Brings players back for "one more run."

### Tier 3: Do After MVP (Medium-high impact, high effort)

**8. Collection hooks**  
- Add a "death collection" screen showing which of 6 endings you’ve unlocked.
- Add a "role progression" screen showing how many cards you’ve seen per role.
- **Effort:** 3–4 hours (new UI screens, state tracking).
- **Impact:** Players will replay to "complete the Pokédex." Extends playtime per session.

**9. Shareable moment**  
- "Share this roast" button that copies a funny text or generates a screenshot.
- **Effort:** 2–3 hours (screenshot lib + copy-to-clipboard logic).
- **Impact:** Viral potential. One shared roast = new player acquisition.

**10. Short-term "win" that backfires**  
- Add 1–2 cards where right gives a hype bump ("Board loved it!") and then the next card reveals the delayed consequence.
- **Effort:** 3–4 hours (multi-card state logic).
- **Impact:** Subverts expectations, teaches deferred risk. High learning + addictiveness.

### Tier 4: Nice-to-have (Lower priority, high effort)

**11. Sound / haptic feedback**  
- Swipe sound, match-like "ding" for left, alert sound for fine.
- **Effort:** 4–5 hours (audio assets, haptic API, testing).
- **Impact:** Satisfying but not critical to core loop.

**12. Variable outcome on "left"**  
- Occasionally left also has downsides ("Board wanted bold move, now they’re mad").
- **Effort:** 2–3 hours but **risky** — can confuse learning (left should reliably be safe).
- **Impact:** Adds surprise, but reduces the clarity that "left = compliant." Skip unless you want ambiguous scenarios.

### Recommended 4-Week Plan

| Week | Focus | Effort | Expected Impact |
|------|-------|--------|-----------------|
| **1** | Tier 1 (make right tempting, variable outcomes, left feedback, skip button) | 4–5 hrs | +30% addictiveness |
| **2** | Streaks + difficulty curve | 4–5 hrs | +40% replay rate |
| **3** | Near-death recovery + more cards per role | 5–6 hrs | +50% playtime per session |
| **4** | Collection hooks + shareable moments | 5–6 hrs | +20% viral coefficient |

### TL;DR: Start with this sequence

1. **Tempt harder (make right irresistible)**
2. **Variable outcomes (uncertain reward on right)**
3. **Reward left (satisfying feedback for compliance)**
4. **Streaks (addictiveness engine)**
5. **Difficulty curve (pacing & overconfidence trap)**

These five alone will roughly **2x the addictiveness** while keeping the learning sharp. Everything else is polish or viral distribution.
