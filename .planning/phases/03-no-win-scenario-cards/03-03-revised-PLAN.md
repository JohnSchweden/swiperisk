<objective>
Integrate 80+ new no-win scenario cards for all 10 roles into the game loop, wire pressure metadata for ~20% of high-stakes cards, and validate that deck shuffle includes all new content without breaking existing functionality.

Purpose: Ensure new cards are live in game (no dead code), time pressure is calibrated for impact (not fatigue), and all systems work cohesively for ALL 10 ROLES (Chief Something Officer, Head of Something, Something Manager, Tech AI Consultant, Data Scientist, Software Architect, Software Engineer, Vibe Coder, Vibe Engineer, Agentic Engineer).

Output: Updated game state, pressure metadata mapping for 10-role card set, E2E tests validating card variety and pressure integration.

## CRITICAL: 10 New Roles

This plan integrates cards for ALL 10 new roles:
1. Chief Something Officer (cso_* card IDs)
2. Head of Something (hos_* card IDs)
3. Something Manager (sm_* card IDs)
4. Tech AI Consultant (tac_* card IDs)
5. Data Scientist (ds_* card IDs)
6. Software Architect (sa_* card IDs)
7. Software Engineer (se_* card IDs)
8. Vibe Coder (vc_* card IDs)
9. Vibe Engineer (ve_* card IDs)
10. Agentic Engineer (ae_* card IDs)

## Existing Pressure Infrastructure (from Phase 04)

From types.ts:
```typescript
export interface PressureScenarioMetadata {
  urgent: boolean;                          // If true, countdown starts
  countdownSec: number;                     // Timer duration
  timeoutResolvesTo: "LEFT" | "RIGHT";      // Auto-choice on expiry
  criticalForHaptics?: boolean;             // Trigger haptic escalation
  outcomes?: {
    LEFT?: { teamImpact?: string };
    RIGHT?: { teamImpact?: string };
  };
}
```

From Phase 04 implementation:
- `useIncidentPressure` hook: Manages countdown state, checks PressureScenarioMetadata
- `PressureCueController`: Orchestrates audio (heartbeat) + haptics (vibration) escalation
- `CardStack.tsx`: Renders countdown timer UI when urgent=true
- `pressureAudio`: Audio escalation when heat high or timer active
- Timer expiry: Calls `onComplete` with automatically resolved choice

## Time Pressure Distribution (~20% of cards)

High-stakes categories (mark as urgent=true, countdownSec=30-60):
1. Security incident with public disclosure (customer finds bug, not internal discovery)
2. Legal escalation / regulatory audit
3. Budget cliff (major cost decision, $500K+)
4. Team safety / ethical violation
5. Immediate reputation crisis
6. Agent autonomy emergency (for Agentic Engineer)

Heuristic: If outcome involves prison, audit failure, major budget burn, public scandal, or emergent AI behavior → mark urgent.

Example cards to mark urgent (using NEW role prefixes):
- "cso_prompt_injection_liability" (Chief: shareholder lawsuit risk)
- "vc_hallucinated_library" (Vibe Coder: AI generated non-existent dependency)
- "ae_agent_rogue_behavior" (Agentic Engineer: autonomous agent acting unexpectedly)
- "sm_budget_cliff" (Something Manager: $500K decision deadline)
- "ds_model_bias_discovered" (Data Scientist: bias found before deployment)
- "tac_client_contract_cancel" (Tech AI Consultant: client threatening cancellation)

Target: ~15-18 of 80+ cards marked urgent (20% of 80 = 16 cards).

## Shuffle Integration (from Phase 12)

From STATE.md, Phase 12-00-PLAN.md:
- Game.PLAYING stage: Initialize `effectiveDeck` as shuffled copy of ROLE_CARDS[state.role]
- useGameState dispatch: `{ type: "INITIALIZE", payload: { deck: shuffleArray(ROLE_CARDS[role]) } }`
- Shuffle function: `shuffleArray(array)` (Fisher-Yates)
- Result: Card order randomized on each game start

Phase 03 adds 80+ cards across 10 roles to ROLE_CARDS. Shuffle logic automatically includes them (no changes needed to shuffle function).

**Validation:** Play 5+ games across multiple roles, verify different card orders.

## Personality Feedback Integration (existing, Phase 01)

Personality voices already wired in FeedbackOverlay:
- Selects feedback based on state.personality + card outcome
- Each outcome has `feedback[PersonalityType.ROASTER]` etc.
- All 80+ new cards have 3-voice feedback (created in Plan 02-revised)
- No changes needed; just validate new feedback renders correctly

## Pressure Metadata Lookup

After Phase 04, pressure lookup pattern:
```typescript
// In useIncidentPressure or CardStack
const metadata = PRESSURE_METADATA[currentCard.id];
if (metadata?.urgent) {
  startCountdown(metadata.countdownSec);
  setTeamImpact(metadata.outcomes?.RIGHT?.teamImpact);
}
```

Phase 03 Plan 03 task: Define PRESSURE_METADATA with entries for ~20% of cards (high-stakes) using NEW card ID prefixes.

## Test Strategy (from RESEARCH.md Phase 04)

Phase 04 completed:
- Countdown timer starts/stops correctly
- Haptics fire on critical state + timer expiry
- Audio escalation (heartbeat) reacts to heat + timer
- Pressure metadata is optional (cards without metadata still play)

Phase 03 validates:
- New cards for ALL 10 ROLES included in shuffle
- Pressure metadata wired for correct cards (not all cards)
- E2E: Play full games as different roles, verify card variety in history
- No regression in existing card playability

## Card Sourcing Metadata (from Plan 02-revised)

tests/data/card-sources.json populated with:
- cardId → incident source, date, category, role, reference URL
- Used for debrief mapping (Phase 06)
- Not needed for Phase 03 integration (just validation reference)

```

**Urgent card selection heuristic by role:**
- Chief Something Officer: Shareholder liability, regulatory escalation, whistleblowers
- Head of Something: Team crises, political emergencies, blame escalation
- Something Manager: Budget deadlines, compliance deadlines, resource conflicts
- Tech AI Consultant: Client emergencies, contract deadlines, deliverable crises
- Data Scientist: Pre-deployment bias discovery, model failures, data quality crises
- Software Architect: Production outages, scalability failures, architecture emergencies
- Software Engineer: Security breaches, critical bugs, deployment failures
- Vibe Coder: AI code emergencies, hallucination crises, prompt failures
- Vibe Engineer: Performance crises, latency spikes, infrastructure failures
- Agentic Engineer: Agent autonomy failures, emergent behavior crises, automation breakdowns

**countdownSec calibration:**
- Security/Agent emergencies: 30-45 sec (immediate response needed)
- Budget/Contract decisions: 45-60 sec (financial stakes)
- Team/Architecture crises: 35-50 sec (balancing multiple factors)

**Validation:** Count cards in PRESSURE_METADATA, should be ~15-18 (20% of 80+). Run tests.

  <name>Task 2: Update useGameState.ts — Include new 10-role cards in shuffle</name>
  <files>hooks/useGameState.ts</files>
  <behavior>
    - On PLAYING stage initialization: shuffle includes all 80+ cards for selected role
    - Verify ROLE_CARDS now points to 10 new role-specific card arrays
    - Add pressure metadata lookup: `const pressureMetadata = PRESSURE_METADATA[cardId]`
    - Pass pressure metadata to CardStack + pressure hooks via state/props
    - No changes to core game logic (deck selection, decision flow) — just data wiring
  </behavior>
  <action>
Update `hooks/useGameState.ts`:

1. Verify ROLE_CARDS import points to updated data/cards/index.ts with 10 new role-specific arrays
2. In INITIALIZING → PLAYING transition, shuffle deck as before (no change needed):
   ```typescript
   case "INITIALIZE":
     const deck = shuffleArray(ROLE_CARDS[payload.role]); // Now includes role-specific cards
     return { ...state, effectiveDeck: deck, ... };
   ```
3. Add PRESSURE_METADATA import at top:
   ```typescript
   import { PRESSURE_METADATA } from "../data/pressure-metadata";
   ```
4. Add pressure metadata to state (if not already present):
   ```typescript
   export interface GameState {
     // ... existing fields
     currentCardPressure?: PressureScenarioMetadata; // New field
   }
   ```
5. On card draw, lookup and store pressure metadata:
   ```typescript
   case "DRAW_CARD":
     const currentCard = state.effectiveDeck[state.currentCardIndex];
     const pressure = PRESSURE_METADATA[currentCard.id];
     return {
       ...state,
       currentCardPressure: pressure,
       // ... existing logic
     };
   ```
6. Verify no TypeScript errors: `npm run build`

This wires pressure data through the game state for ALL 10 ROLES. Pressure hooks (useIncidentPressure, etc.) will read currentCardPressure from state.

    <automated>npm run build 2>&1 | grep -i error | head -5</automated>

    - No new features needed; just validate existing rendering handles 80+ new cards across 10 roles
  </behavior>
  <action>
Audit `components/CardStack.tsx`:

1. Verify card rendering includes:
   - card.source (source icon, already wired in Phase 12)
   - card.sender (who raised the incident)
   - card.storyContext (scene-setting immersion text)
   - card.text (the dilemma)

2. Verify pressure UI:
   - Countdown timer renders when useIncidentPressure().isActive
   - Team impact text renders from FeedbackOverlay
   - No new UI needed

3. Test with new cards from multiple roles:
   - Component should render without errors for all 10 roles
   - Source icons display correctly for all AppSource values
   - Long text wraps properly (some new cards may have longer scenarios)

4. If any rendering issues (text truncation, layout breaks):
   - Adjust CSS/Tailwind classes
   - Test on mobile (ensure text readable under pressure)

No code changes expected; just validation that existing rendering works with new 10-role card data.

2. Verify state passed to child components:
   - CardStack receives currentCard + currentCardPressure
   - FeedbackOverlay receives pressure state for team impact text
   - HUD receives pressure state for heat/budget escalation

3. Verify all 10 roles can be selected and played:
   - Role selection UI shows all 10 new roles
   - Each role gets its specific card deck
   - No console errors when switching roles

4. If any wiring is missing:
   - Add pressure state to context or props
   - Wire pressure metadata from useGameState to pressure hooks

**Note:** E2E tests may be flaky due to random shuffle. Use high timeout values and non-blocking assertions for optional elements.

**Data attributes to add (if not present):**
- `data-card-id` on card element
- `data-test="countdown-timer"` on timer element

Update CardStack.tsx to add these attributes if missing.

  <name>Task 6: Add data attributes to CardStack.tsx for E2E testing</name>
  <files>components/CardStack.tsx</files>
  <behavior>
    - Add `data-card-id={card.id}` to card container
    - Add `data-test="countdown-timer"` to countdown timer element (if present)
    - No visual changes, just attributes for test selectors
  </behavior>
  <action>
Update CardStack.tsx:

1. Find card container element, add:
   ```jsx
   <div data-card-id={card.id} className="...">
     {/* card content */}
   </div>
   ```

2. Find countdown timer component, add:
   ```jsx
   {pressure?.urgent && (
     <div data-test="countdown-timer" className="...">
       {countdown}s
     </div>
   )}
   ```

These are test-only attributes, don't affect styling or functionality.

  <name>Task 7: Run full test suite — Regression validation for 10-role system</name>
  <files></files>
  <action>
Run complete test suite to ensure no regressions:

```bash
npm test
```

Expected results:
- Unit tests pass (all existing game logic intact)
- E2E tests pass (deck shuffle works for all 10 roles, pressure integration works)
- Data tests pass (all 80+ cards valid across 10 roles)
- No errors in console during gameplay

If any test fails:
1. Identify failure location
2. Fix issue in source (e.g., missing import, wrong state field)
3. Re-run until all green

Common failures:
- Missing PRESSURE_METADATA import → add to useGameState.ts
- CardStack rendering error → verify data attributes are strings
- Shuffle includes duplicates → verify shuffleArray works
- Pressure metadata not wired → verify useGameState passes to CardStack
- Role not found → verify all 10 roles in ROLE_CARDS mapping

Create git commit for Phase 03 integration work:

```bash
git add data/pressure-metadata.ts hooks/useGameState.ts tests/e2e/card-deck.spec.ts
git commit -m "feat(03): integrate pressure metadata for 10-role system

- Create pressure-metadata.ts: 15-18 high-stakes cards marked urgent
  - Covers all 10 new roles: cso, hos, sm, tac, ds, sa, se, vc, ve, ae
  - Security breaches, agent emergencies, budget cliffs
  - Timer: 30-70 seconds depending on scenario and role
  - Auto-resolve: timeoutResolvesTo LEFT or RIGHT per card
  - Team impact: Crew consequences visible in feedback overlay

- Update useGameState.ts:
  - Import 10-role ROLE_CARDS (80+ cards)
  - Lookup PRESSURE_METADATA on card draw
  - Pass currentCardPressure through state to CardStack

- Verify CardStack.tsx renders all 10-role card data
  - Source icons, sender, storyContext, text
  - Timer UI when urgent=true
  - No regressions with role-specific scenarios

- Create E2E tests (card-deck.spec.ts):
  - All 10 roles selectable and playable
  - Shuffle includes role-specific cards
  - Different games have different card orders
  - Urgent cards display timer UI
  - All 6 incident categories appear

- Add test attributes (data-card-id, data-test='countdown-timer')

Tests passing: Unit, E2E, Data validation. Ready for UAT (Phase 03 Plan 04-revised)."
