 * Agentic Engineer cards - Autonomous AI systems scenarios
 * Themes: autonomous agents, automation failures, emergent behavior,
 * agent governance, multi-agent coordination, autonomous decision-making
 *
 * This is a NEW ROLE focused on autonomous AI systems.
 * NOT traditional automation - distinct focus on agent autonomy and emergent risks.
 *
 * All cards sourced from real 2024-2025 incidents:
 * - Autonomous agent failures
 * - Emergent AI behavior patterns
 * - Multi-agent coordination issues
 * - Agent governance challenges
