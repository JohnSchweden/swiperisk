## Key Decisions Log

| Date | Decision | Context | Outcome |
|------|----------|---------|---------|
| 2026-02-07 | Desktop centered, Mobile top-anchored | Desktop has space for centering; mobile feels more app-like when top-anchored | — Pending validation |
| 2026-02-07 | Keep contextual text labels (not icons) | "Debug" vs "Paste" are contextual, not yes/no | — Pending validation |
| 2026-02-07 | No opacity fade on swipe | Must keep card text readable during decisions | — Pending validation |
| 2026-02-07 | scrollbar-gutter: stable for desktop | Prevents layout shifts from scrollbar | — Pending implementation |
| 2026-02-07 | Spring physics (soft bouncy feel) | Premium feel without being jarring | — Pending implementation |
| 2026-02-07 | Card stack showing next card | Creates "deck" feel, shows progression | — Pending implementation |
