 * - Chief Something Officer: C-suite governance, liability, board pressure
 * - Head of Something: Middle management, team politics, blame shielding
 * - Something Manager: Budget spreadsheets, ROI, resource allocation
 * - Tech AI Consultant: Client contracts, vendor lock-in, deliverables
 * - Data Scientist: Model quality, bias, explainability, training data
 * - Software Architect: System design, technical debt, scalability
 * - Software Engineer: Implementation, security, code quality
 * - Vibe Coder: AI-assisted coding, prompts, LLM hallucinations (NEW)
 * - Vibe Engineer: Performance, latency, optimization, caching (NEW)
