## Key Decisions Log

| Date | Decision | Context | Outcome |
|------|----------|---------|---------|
| 2026-02-07 | Desktop centered, Mobile top-anchored | Desktop has space for centering; mobile feels more app-like when top-anchored | — Pending validation |
| 2026-02-07 | Keep contextual text labels (not icons) | "Debug" vs "Paste" are contextual, not yes/no | — Pending validation |
| 2026-02-07 | No opacity fade on swipe | Must keep card text readable during decisions | — Pending validation |
| 2026-02-07 | scrollbar-gutter: stable for desktop | Prevents layout shifts from scrollbar | — Pending implementation |
| 2026-02-07 | Spring physics (soft bouncy feel) | Premium feel without being jarring | — Pending implementation |
| 2026-02-07 | Card stack showing next card | Creates "deck" feel, shows progression | — Pending implementation |
| 2026-02-07 | CSS cubic-bezier for spring | Soft bouncy with overshoot | — Documented in Phase 2 context |
| 2026-02-07 | Next card: scale 0.95, opacity 0.6 | Visible but dimmed | — Documented in Phase 2 context |
| 2026-02-07 | Fade only for stage transitions | Simple, consistent, doesn't compete with swipe | — Documented in Phase 3 context |
| 2026-02-07 | Animation timing hierarchy | Quick/medium/slow based on purpose | — Documented in Phase 3 context |
| 2026-02-07 | Comprehensive design audit | Typography, colors, spacing, components | — Documented in Phase 3 context |
| 2026-02-07 | NO card lift on drag | User decision to remove SWIPE-02 | — Documented in Phase 2 context |
| 2026-02-07 | Desktop centered, Mobile top-anchored | Desktop has space for centering; mobile feels more app-like when top-anchored | ✓ Implemented in LayoutShell (01-01) |
