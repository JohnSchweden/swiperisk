## Overview

**Swipe Risk: The Hyperscale Chronicles** — a single-page React card-swiping game about AI/tech ethics. Players choose a role (Finance, Marketing, Management) and AI personality, then swipe through workplace dilemma cards that affect Hype, Heat, and Budget stats. Ends in a boss fight quiz or one of several failure endings.

Key features: gesture-based card swiping, TTS via Gemini 2.5 Flash, multiple endings, Playwright E2E test suite.

## Architecture

```
App.tsx                    # Root — mounts game, wires hooks to components
index.tsx                  # Entry point
types.ts                   # All shared types (GameState, Card, GameStage, etc.)

components/
  LayoutShell.tsx           # Responsive container wrapper
  game/                     # All game screen components
    IntroScreen, PersonalitySelect, RoleSelect, InitializingScreen
    GameScreen, CardStack, GameHUD, FeedbackOverlay
    BossFight, GameOver, SummaryScreen, RoastTerminal, Taskbar

hooks/
  useGameState.ts           # Core useReducer state machine
  useSwipeGestures.ts       # Touch/mouse gesture handling
  useVoicePlayback.ts       # TTS playback state
  useBossFight.ts           # Boss quiz logic
  useRoast.ts               # AI roast commentary

**State flow**: `useGameState` (useReducer) → dispatches actions → components re-render. Stage transitions validated against `STAGE_TRANSITIONS` map.

<!-- AUTO-MANAGED: conventions -->
## Code Conventions

- **Components**: PascalCase files, `.tsx` extension, `components/game/` for game screens
- **Hooks**: `use` prefix, camelCase, one concern per hook (`useSwipeGestures`, `useVoicePlayback`)
- **Imports**: `import type` for type-only imports; `@/` alias for root-relative paths
- **Formatting**: Biome — tabs, double quotes in TSX, no trailing semicolons enforced by linter
- **Types**: Centralized in `types.ts`; enums for `GameStage`, `DeathType`, `RoleType`, `PersonalityType`
- **Testing**: Playwright E2E tagged with `@smoke`, `@area:*`, `@visual`, `@slow`; Vitest for unit tests in `unit/`
- **Linting**: Run `bun run check` before committing; husky + lint-staged auto-runs Biome on staged files

<!-- AUTO-MANAGED: patterns -->
## Detected Patterns

- **Finite state machine**: `GameStage` enum + `STAGE_TRANSITIONS` map validates all stage changes; illegal transitions are blocked
- **Custom hooks as controllers**: Each major subsystem (swipe, voice, boss fight, roast) is a custom hook; `App.tsx` composes them
- **Barrel exports**: `components/game/index.ts`, `data/index.ts`, `hooks/index.ts` — import from directory, not individual files
- **Role-scoped content**: Card decks, death endings, and boss questions are keyed by `RoleType` — add new content by extending the role map
- **Personality-scoped feedback**: Each `ChoiceOutcome` contains a `feedback: Record<PersonalityType, string>` — all three personalities must have entries
- **Env-gated features**: `VITE_ENABLE_SPEECH=false` disables TTS; `GEMINI_API_KEY` injected at build time via Vite define

## Gitignored Paths
- `.claude/auto-memory/dirty-files` — transient hook-managed file, never commit
- `test-results/`, `playwright-report/`, `reports/` — test and report artifacts, never commit

## Post-Commit Hook System
- `.husky/post-commit` — runs two background scripts after every commit (detached, never blocks workflow)
- `~/.claude/hooks/claude-analyze.sh` — diffs `HEAD~1..HEAD`, extracts lessons via Claude CLI (haiku), appends to `tasks/lessons.md`
- `~/.claude/hooks/claude-simplify.sh` — reviews committed `.ts/.tsx` files for quality issues via Claude CLI (haiku), writes to `.planning/logs/simplify-latest.md`
- Both scripts live globally (work in any repo); logs go to `.planning/logs/`
