## v1.2: Kobayashi Maru — AI Governance Simulator

**Goal:** Transform K-Maru into the Kobayashi Maru for AI risk, governance, and compliance — a safe sandbox where people experience real AI incidents without real consequences.

**Core Design Principle:** "You will fail. That's the point." — Learn by breaking things in a safe environment.

**Requirements (Kobayashi Maru Framework):**

- FRAME-01 to FRAME-03: Reframe as no-win experimentation sandbox
- NOWIN-01 to NOWIN-04: Add no-win scenario cards (both options bad)
- IMMERSE-01 to IMMERSE-05: Psychological pressure + immersive effects
- RISK-01 to RISK-06: Expanded AI risk scenarios (day-to-day incidents)
- DEBRIEF-01 to DEBRIEF-12: 3-page debrief + archetype + LinkedIn share + V2 waitlist
- KIRK-01 to KIRK-02: Hidden "Kirk" path Easter egg

**Gameplay tweaks:**
- **Shuffle deck:** When entering `PLAYING`, use a shuffled copy of `ROLE_CARDS[state.role]` so card order isn't fixed.
- **Branching:** Optional "if they swiped right on card X, show card Y" so some cards only appear after bad choices.

**App source infrastructure:**
- Add values to `AppSource` (e.g. `JIRA`, `NOTION`, `MEETING`). Purely cosmetic — makes scenarios feel more varied.
- Create `SOURCE_ICONS` mapping for each source's Font Awesome icon, update CardStack to use it.

- **Outcome images** — Sarcastic Stock Photos (polished corporate + disaster subject)
- **Collapse image** — Dramatic failure (e.g. yacht sinking, drone with audit report)
- **Archetype images** — Tactical patch / futuristic tarot card style (LinkedIn shareable)

**Pipeline:** Write prompts → generate → save to `public/images/` or asset folder → define mapping (cardId/outcomeId/archetypeId → image path).

**Requirements:**
- PIPELINE-01: Image prompt library (incidents, outcomes, collapse, archetypes)
- PIPELINE-02: Script or process to generate + save images locally
- PIPELINE-03: File naming convention + directory structure
