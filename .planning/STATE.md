## Phase Structure

| Phase | Goal | Requirements | Status |
|-------|------|--------------|--------|
| 1 - Voice Files | 13 voice files + playback system | VOICE-01 to VOICE-07 | Complete ✓ |
| 2 - Live API | Real-time streaming for Roast.exe | VOICE-08 to VOICE-10 | In Progress (3/4) |

---

## Accumulated Context

### Design Decisions
- Pre-recorded voice samples (not TTS) for quality
- WAV format (PCM 16-bit, 24kHz, mono) for browser compatibility
- localStorage for settings persistence
- Volume reduced by 40% (0.6) for comfortable listening

### Technical Notes
- Voice narration tied to personality system
- Current Roast.exe uses simple TTS API (waits for full response)
- Phase 2 explores Gemini Live API for streaming audio
- Personality paths normalized (ZEN_MASTER → zenmaster)
- **NEW:** Direct browser connection using ephemeral tokens (no backend proxy)
- **NEW:** AudioWorklet for 24kHz→48kHz sample rate conversion
- **NEW:** roastService.ts with getRoastWithFallback for automatic Live API → TTS fallback

### Blockers
- None identified

## Session Continuity

**Last action:** 2026-03-01 - Completed 02-03-PLAN.md (Live API integration with fallback)

**Next action:** Ready for next phase or milestone completion
