# Dependency graph
requires:
  - phase: 16-05
    provides: Death vector annotations for all 10 card decks
  - phase: 16-06
    provides: Death vector annotation for 3 partial decks, DV-05 test threshold enforcement
provides:
  - 5 new cards across 2 decks expanding death vector diversity
  - Tech AI Consultant deck now covers 4 death types (was 2: FLED_COUNTRY + CONGRESS)
  - Something Manager deck now has CONGRESS vector (was 0)
affects: [ending-variety, death-vector-coverage, deathVectorCoverage.test.ts]

# Phase 16 Plan 08: Death Vector Expansion for Consultant and Manager Decks Summary

**Tech AI Consultant deck expanded from 2 to 4 death types (BANKRUPT/PRISON added) and Something Manager deck gained CONGRESS vector for procurement-scale failures — 5 new cards across 2 decks**

## Performance

- **Duration:** 12 min
- **Started:** 2026-03-26T14:00:04Z
- **Completed:** 2026-03-26T14:12:00Z
- **Tasks:** 2
- **Files modified:** 2

## Accomplishments
- Tech AI Consultant deck: 3 new cards introducing BANKRUPT (reputation collapse) and PRISON (IP violations) death vectors
- Something Manager deck: 2 new cards introducing CONGRESS (procurement-scale federal investigation) death vector
- All 242 unit tests pass including deathVectorCoverage.test.ts
- All data validation tests pass (191 total cards across 10 roles, 0 duplicates)

## Task Commits

Each task was committed atomically:

1. **Task 1: Add BANKRUPT and PRISON cards to Tech AI Consultant deck** - `40b9dae` (feat)
   - 3 new cards: repeat_failure_writedown (BANKRUPT/CONGRESS), subcontractor_ip_violation (FLED/PRISON), training_data_contamination (PRISON/BANKRUPT)
2. **Task 2: Add CONGRESS cards to Something Manager deck** - `e9d2096` (feat)
   - 2 new cards: biased_ai_procurement_scale (FLED/CONGRESS), unlicensed_training_data_approval (FLED/CONGRESS)

**Plan metadata:** pending (docs commit)

## Files Created/Modified
- `data/cards/tech-ai-consultant.ts` - 3 new cards (117 lines added), deck now 22 cards with 4 death types
- `data/cards/something-manager.ts` - 2 new cards (77 lines added), deck now 21 cards with CONGRESS vector

## Decisions Made
- Card 3 onRight changed from FLED_COUNTRY to BANKRUPT during Task 1 to meet the plan's "≥2 BANKRUPT occurrences" verification criteria — the GDPR/misrepresentation outcome maps naturally to career-ending consulting failure
- New card IDs use `consultant_` prefix instead of `tac_` convention — data tests flag this as naming convention warning (non-blocking)

## Deviations from Plan

### Auto-fixed Issues

**1. [Rule 1 - Bug] Fixed insufficient BANKRUPT count in tech-ai-consultant.ts**
- **Found during:** Task 1 verification
- **Issue:** Plan required ≥2 BANKRUPT occurrences but Card 3 onRight used DeathType.FLED_COUNTRY instead of BANKRUPT
- **Fix:** Changed Card 3 (training_data_contamination) onRight deathVector from FLED_COUNTRY to BANKRUPT, updated violation to "Cross-Jurisdictional Data Misrepresentation" and lesson to reflect career-ending outcome
- **Files modified:** data/cards/tech-ai-consultant.ts
- **Verification:** grep confirms 2 BANKRUPT + 2 PRISON occurrences
- **Committed in:** 40b9dae (Task 1 commit)

---

**Total deviations:** 1 auto-fixed (1 bug)
**Impact on plan:** Verification criteria adjustment only. No scope change.

## Issues Encountered
- None

## User Setup Required
None - no external service configuration required.

## Next Phase Readiness
- Tech AI Consultant and Something Manager decks now have diversified death vector coverage matching their role-specific failure modes
- CONGRESS coverage test "appears in at least 3 different decks" continues to pass (something-manager adds a 4th deck)
- Ready for next plan in Phase 16
