## Current Test

[testing complete]

## Tests

### 1. Shuffle Deck on Game Start
expected: Start a new game. Play through several cards and note the card sequence. Start another new game with the same role. The card sequence should be different (different order of cards shown).
result: pass

### 2. Branching Card Logic
expected: Select a role and play the game. When you encounter a "Paste" choice and select it, a consequence card should appear next. The consequence card should only appear after that specific choice—don't see it if you had made a different choice.
result: issue
reported: "No consequence card, everything appears to be exactly as it is. I just see the feedback overlay and that's all."
severity: major

### 3. Card Source Icons Display
expected: Play through the game and observe the card headers. Each card should display the appropriate icon based on its source (email shows envelope icon, JIRA shows checklist, Notion shows document, etc.). Icons should be consistent across all card types.
result: pass

### 4. Game Starts Without Errors
expected: Start a new game with any role. The game should load without console errors, shuffle the deck, and present the first card immediately. No loading delays or broken UI.
result: pass

### 5. Branch Injection at Correct Position
expected: Play through the game. When a branching choice is made (like Paste), the injected consequence card should appear immediately after the current card, not randomly in the deck.
result: pass
