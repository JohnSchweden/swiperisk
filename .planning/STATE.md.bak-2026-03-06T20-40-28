## Accumulated Context

### Roadmap Evolution
- Phase 01 added: Live API STT Research (STT for microphone input)
- Phase 02 added: Kobayashi Maru Framing (deferred → Phase 08)
- Phase 03 added: No-Win Scenario Cards
- Phase 04 added: Immersive Pressure Effects
- Phase 05 added: Expanded AI Risk Scenarios
- Phase 06 added: Debrief & Replay System
- Phase 06 extended: 3-page Reveal Build-Up, archetype, LinkedIn share, V2 waitlist (06-ARCHITECTURE.md)
- Phase 07 added: Kirk Easter Egg
- Phase 13 added: Image Asset Pipeline (prompts, generate, save locally, mapping)
- Phase 14 added: Situational & Outcome Imagery Display (placement, mobile/web sizing)

### Design Decisions
- Pre-recorded voice samples (not TTS) for quality
- WAV format (PCM 16-bit, 24kHz, mono) for browser compatibility
- localStorage for settings persistence
- Volume reduced by 40% (0.6) for comfortable listening
- Direct browser connection using GoogleGenAI SDK (no backend proxy)
- AudioWorklet for 24kHz→48kHz sample rate conversion
- roastService.ts with getRoastWithFallback for automatic Live API → TTS fallback
- **Kobayashi Maru framing:** "You will fail. That's the point." — Safe experimentation sandbox
- **Glitched Corporate Surrealism:** AI-generated images with visible artifacts (uncanny valley) — supports Project Icarus narrative
- **Archetype images:** Tactical patch / futuristic tarot style — LinkedIn shareable badges

### Technical Debt
- hooks/useLiveAudio.ts not imported anywhere (functionality in roastService.ts)
- hooks/useLiveAPISpeechRecognition.ts now provides STT functionality via Gemini Live API

### Blockers
- None
