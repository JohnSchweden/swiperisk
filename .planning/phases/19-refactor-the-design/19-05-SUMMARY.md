# Phase 19 Plan 05: Remove Duplicate Endings Hint Summary

**Removed the duplicate "Endings discovered: X/6 ...or is it?" block from DebriefPage3Verdict — identical content already displayed on DebriefPage1Collapse (page 1)**

## Performance

- **Duration:** 15 min
- **Started:** 2026-03-28T23:45:01Z
- **Completed:** 2026-03-29T00:00:17Z
- **Tasks:** 1
- **Files modified:** 1

## Accomplishments
- Removed "Endings discovered: X/6 ...or is it?" hint block from DebriefPage3Verdict
- Cleaned up `unlockedEndingsCount` from component props interface and destructuring
- LinkedIn CTA now remains as the final element on the verdict page

## Task Commits

Each task was committed atomically:

1. **Task 1: Remove endings hint from DebriefPage3Verdict** - `4c30b5b` (refactor)

**Plan metadata:** (included in final commit below)

## Files Created/Modified
- `components/game/debrief/DebriefPage3Verdict.tsx` — Removed 10 lines: hint block JSX + unused prop + destructuring

## Decisions Made
- None — followed plan as specified. The hint was a clear duplicate of content on page 1.

## Deviations from Plan

None - plan executed exactly as written.

## Issues Encountered

- Pre-commit hook (lint-staged) stash conflict caused two failed commit attempts. Resolved by resetting the file from git and re-applying changes cleanly.

## Next Phase Readiness
- Debrief page 3 is cleaner — LinkedIn CTA is the final element as intended
- Ready for next design refactor plan
