# K-Maru: The Hyperscale Chronicles

An AI-powered compliance and cybersecurity education game built with React, TypeScript, and Google's Gemini AI. Swipe through ethical dilemmas, manage your corporate reputation, and try to survive the startup chaos without ending up in prison, Congress, or worse.

## 🎮 What is This?

**K-Maru** is a swipe-based decision game (inspired by Reigns/Tinder mechanics) where you play as an executive at a hyperscale tech company. You'll face realistic AI ethics and cybersecurity scenarios drawn from real-world tech controversies.

### Key Features

- **AI Voice Commentary** - Your chosen AI personality provides sarcastic, zen, or hype-filled commentary via Gemini TTS
- **Multiple Playable Roles** - Choose from Development, Marketing, Management, HR, Finance, or Cleaning
- **3 AI Personalities** - Each with unique voices (V.E.R.A. the Roaster, Bamboo the Zen Master, HYPE-BRO the Lovebomber)
- **6 Different Endings** - Go bankrupt, flee the country, testify before Congress, and more
- **Boss Fight Quiz** - Test your knowledge with AI safety and compliance questions
- **Responsive Design** - Works on desktop and mobile
