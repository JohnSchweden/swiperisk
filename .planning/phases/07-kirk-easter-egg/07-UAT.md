## Current Test

[testing complete]

## Tests

### 1. IntroScreen Kirk Hint
expected: On the intro/welcome screen, a subtle muted hint line reads "Captain Kirk passed this test. You won't." — styled small and muted (text-slate-500), feels like an Easter egg discovery rather than primary UI.
result: pass

### 2. InitializingScreen [REDACTED] Boot Line
expected: During the initializing/boot screen, one of the boot lines reads "> override protocols: [REDACTED]" — styled with muted red (text-red-400/50), subtle enough to feel redacted but noticeable on a second look.
result: pass

### 3. First Swipe-Up Triggers Glitch (Card Snaps Back)
expected: During gameplay with a card on screen, swipe upward on the card. The card snaps back to center (does not exit). A subtle glitch/flicker visual effect briefly appears on the screen, and a subtle glitch tone plays. No card is discarded.
result: pass

### 4. Second Swipe-Up Triggers Corruption Cascade
expected: Swipe up a second time on a card. A more intense crash sound plays. The screen shows a persistent visual corruption effect (scanline overlay, flickering). Three new "corrupted" cards are injected into the deck from sender "S̶Y̶S̷T̶E̶M̴" — announcing absurd rewards: 200% raise, CEO promotion, Nobel Prize.
result: pass

### 5. Corrupted Cards Offer No Real Choice
expected: The three corrupted cards from "S̶Y̶S̷T̶E̶M̴" can be swiped left or right, but both directions produce identical outcomes — the simulation pretends to give a choice but the result is the same either way.
result: pass

### 6. Kirk Death Screen — SIMULATION BREACH DETECTED
expected: After swiping through all three corrupted cards, the game ends with a special death screen showing: title "SIMULATION BREACH DETECTED" and description "You changed the conditions of the test." — this is distinct from normal failure endings.
result: pass

### 7. Kirk Debrief Page 1 — Corrupted Header
expected: The debrief Page 1 (collapse/summary page) shows a corrupted header with Zalgo-style glitch text and "SIMULATION BREACH" content, visually distinct from normal debrief pages.
result: pass

### 8. Kirk Debrief Page 2 — Personality Break-Character
expected: On debrief Page 2 (audit trail), personality-specific break-character reactions appear — e.g., Roaster is stunned, Zen Master acknowledges the breach, Lovebomber has an existential crisis. The normal "reflection prompt" is hidden (replaced by Kirk-specific narrative).
result: pass

### 9. Kirk Debrief Page 3 — Archetype and LinkedIn Share
expected: On debrief Page 3 (verdict), the archetype shown is "Thinking Outside the Box" with a "Skill Acquired" badge and "Simulation Integrity: 0%". The LinkedIn share button uses Kirk-specific text ("I broke the Kobayashi Maru..."). A subtle "...or is it?" hint appears hinting at a 7th ending.
result: pass

## Gaps

- truth: "Corrupted cards visually pretend to give a choice — accept/reject labels visible so the deception is apparent to the player"
  status: fixed
  reason: "User reported: they only show the same answer for left and right. if it pretends to give a choice then it should see accept or reject"
  severity: major
  test: 5
  root_cause: "All three Kirk cards in data/kirkCards.ts had onLeft.label: 'Accept' instead of 'Reject' — left swipe showed ACCEPT making it look broken rather than deceptively offering a fake choice"
  artifacts:
    - path: "data/kirkCards.ts"
      issue: "onLeft.label was 'Accept' on all 3 cards (lines 34, 73, 111)"
  missing:
    - "Changed onLeft.label to 'Reject' on all 3 corrupted cards"
  debug_session: ""
