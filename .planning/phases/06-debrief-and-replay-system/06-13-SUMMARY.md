# Phase 06 Plan 13: Fix Email Form Submission - API Proxy Error Summary

**Custom Vite plugin that executes Vercel serverless function handlers directly, eliminating the localhost:3001 proxy dependency**

## Performance

- **Duration:** 1 min
- **Started:** 2026-03-12T23:42:44Z
- **Completed:** 2026-03-12T23:43:39Z
- **Tasks:** 1
- **Files modified:** 1

## Accomplishments
- Replaced broken proxy configuration with working Vite plugin
- API routes now execute handlers directly from api/ directory
- Email form submission no longer fails with ECONNREFUSED proxy error
- Development server now fully self-contained for API endpoints

## Task Commits

Each task was committed atomically:

1. **Task 1: Fix API proxy error with Vite plugin** - `dc4cd04` (feat)

**Plan metadata:** TBD (docs: complete plan)

## Files Created/Modified
- `vite.config.ts` - Added apiRoutesPlugin that intercepts /api/* requests and executes the appropriate handler from the api/ directory

## Decisions Made
- Replaced proxy configuration with custom Vite plugin to handle API routes directly
- Created mock VercelRequest/VercelResponse objects to adapt Vite's middleware to Vercel's handler signature

## Deviations from Plan

None - plan executed exactly as written.

## Issues Encountered

None.

## User Setup Required

None - no external service configuration required.

## Next Phase Readiness

- API routes working in development
- Email form submission ready for testing
- No blockers for continued debrief system work
